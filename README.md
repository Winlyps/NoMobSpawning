Required Plugin: https://modrinth.com/plugin/kotlinplugins
- Prevents mobs from spawning naturally ( doesn't affect monster spawners ) thanks to special gamerule. 
- The purpose of this plugin is to strictly reduce the number of possible spawned mobs so server can be more optimized but also to increase the value of mobs around the world.
